# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- Eval viewer static mode (Cowork) now reliably shows the copyable JSON textarea. Previously, `showDoneDialog()` relied on `fetch("/api/feedback")` failing to detect static mode, but in Cowork the fetch doesn't fail because the HTML is served through Cowork's infrastructure. Now `generate_review.py` injects an `is_static` flag into the embedded data, and the JavaScript checks that flag directly.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- `aggregate_benchmark.py` silently produced empty results because it required undocumented `run-*/` subdirectories inside config dirs. The script now reads `grading.json` directly from config directories (e.g., `eval-1/with_skill/grading.json`), matching the layout described in SKILL.md.
- SKILL.md now explicitly states where to save `grading.json` (in each config directory).
- Cowork eval viewer feedback guidance rewritten to explain the *why* instead of using all-caps directives.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-01
