Environment-specific adaptations of the core workflow. Read the section for the environment you're running in.

## Claude.ai-specific instructions

In Claude.ai, the core workflow is the same (draft → test → review → improve → repeat), but because Claude.ai doesn't have subagents, some mechanics change. Here's what to adapt:

**Running test cases**: No subagents means no parallel execution. For each test case, read the skill's SKILL.md, then follow its instructions to accomplish the test prompt yourself. Do them one at a time. This is less rigorous than independent subagents (you wrote the skill and you're also running it, so you have full context), but it's a useful sanity check — and the human review step compensates. Skip the baseline runs — just use the skill to complete the task as requested.

**Reviewing results**: If you can't open a browser (e.g., Claude.ai's VM has no display, or you're on a remote server), skip the browser reviewer entirely. Instead, present results directly in the conversation. For each test case, show the prompt and the output. If the output is a file the user needs to see (like a .docx or .xlsx), save it to the filesystem and tell them where it is so they can download and inspect it. Ask for feedback inline: "How does this look? Anything you'd change?"

**Benchmarking**: Skip the quantitative benchmarking — it relies on baseline comparisons which aren't meaningful without subagents. Focus on qualitative feedback from the user.

**The iteration loop**: Same as before — improve the skill, rerun the test cases, ask for feedback — just without the browser reviewer in the middle. You can still organize results into iteration directories on the filesystem if you have one.

**Description optimization**: This section requires the `claude` CLI tool (specifically `claude -p`) which is only available in Claude Code. Skip it if you're on Claude.ai.

**Blind comparison**: Requires subagents. Skip it.

**Packaging**: The `package_skill.py` script works anywhere with Python and a filesystem. On Claude.ai, you can run it and the user can download the resulting `.skill` file.

**Updating an existing skill**: The user might be asking you to update an existing skill, not create a new one. In this case:
- **Preserve the original name.** Note the skill's directory name and `name` frontmatter field -- use them unchanged. E.g., if the installed skill is `research-helper`, output `research-helper.skill` (not `research-helper-v2`).
- **Copy to a writeable location before editing.** The installed skill path may be read-only. Copy to `/tmp/skill-name/`, edit there, and package from the copy.
- **If packaging manually, stage in `/tmp/` first**, then copy to the output directory -- direct writes may fail due to permissions.

## Cowork-Specific Instructions

If you're in Cowork, the main things to know are:

- You have subagents, so the main workflow (spawn test cases in parallel, run baselines, grade, etc.) all works. (However, if you run into severe problems with timeouts, it's OK to run the test prompts in series rather than parallel.)
- You don't have a browser or display, so when generating the eval viewer, use `--static <output_path>` to write a standalone HTML file instead of starting a server. Then proffer a link that the user can click to open the HTML in their browser.
- Claude tends to skip the eval viewer in Cowork and jump straight to analyzing results itself. This defeats the purpose — the human needs to see the outputs and give feedback before you revise anything. Always run `generate_review.py` first (not your own custom HTML), then wait for the human to review. The eval viewer exists so the human can form their own opinion before you start making changes.
- **Feedback loop workaround (IMPORTANT):** In static mode there is no server, so the viewer cannot POST feedback to disk. When the user clicks "Submit All Reviews", the viewer shows the raw JSON in a copyable textarea. You (Claude) cannot read browser downloads, so the feedback loop requires one of these:
  1. The user **pastes the JSON** directly into the chat — you parse it inline. (Primary path; the viewer does not download any file.)
  2. The user **saves the JSON themselves** as `feedback.json` in the workspace folder you're using — you then read it with the Read tool.
  When you tell the user "come back and tell me you're done reviewing", also say: *"The viewer will show your feedback as JSON — please copy it and paste it here."* Don't assume a file will appear on its own.
- Packaging works — `package_skill.py` just needs Python and a filesystem.
- Description optimization (`run_loop.py` / `run_eval.py`) should work in Cowork just fine since it uses `claude -p` via subprocess, not a browser, but please save it until you've fully finished making the skill and the user agrees it's in good shape.
- **Updating an existing skill**: The user might be asking you to update an existing skill, not create a new one. Follow the update guidance in the claude.ai section above.
